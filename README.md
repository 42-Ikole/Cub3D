# Cub3D

A questionable raycasting game based on Wolfenstein 3d ðŸŽ®

### Prerequisites

This program uses mlx for an older version of mac so it might not work :/

## Usage

Include the header in your c file and compile with the library and you should be good to go!
```sh
make bonus
```
You can run the program by
```sh
./cub3d maps/map_bonus.cub
```

## note
**A valid map is enclosed (checks eight neighbours) and must have a .cub file extension
